# BFC

My basic brainfuck compiler.
It has a few optimisations, noted below.
Also the assembly is probably quite inefficient, however it works with the tic-tac-toe and mandelbrot examples.

## Optimisations

-   [x] Combine multiple of the same instruction
-   [x] Combine multiple of the opposite instruction
